# CA3-Assignment
CA3: Markdown, HTML, CSS, Git

There are 4 tasks that you should work through:
Create a repository on GitHub, and clone it to your local machine.
Style the provided HTML page using CSS. As you complete this step, make sure that you...
...make at least three commits as you complete task 2.
Push your repository to GitHub, take screenshots, and submit.

1. Create a repository on GitHub
If you do not already have a GitHub account, you will need to create one. The Git Learning Activity will guide you through this process.
Create a new repository for this CA task.
Clone the repository to your local machine.


2. Apply CSS to a HTML file
You have been provided with a HTML file that contains some internal CSS. Using this file, style the page according to the following directions. The CSS Learning Activity will assist you with this process.

Note: Remember to commit your work regularly as you complete this task. (See Task #3).

Set the background color of the page to `c-background-color`.
Set the background color of the header and footer to `c-background-highlights`.
Set the text color in the main, footer, and header to be `base-font-color`.
Links in the article should be c-magenta. (If there are no links in the article, add some!)
 When the mouse hovers over a link, it should be highlighted orange.
Create a border around each subsection of the article, including the subsection heading. The border should be solid, 3px wide, and be `c-cyan` in color.
Align the Header in the center, and set the text size to 150%. The heading should be c-yellow.
Remove the bullet points from the unordered list in the nav section.
For the list items in the nav section list, align to the center, and apply a flex layout. (Hint: this is hard. The nav bar needs to be the entire width of the page in order for all items here to be displayed correctly). 
Color all text in the aside to c-green. All links in the aside should be c-red, except when they are hovered over, when they should be c-blue.
Set the maximum width of the page to 800px.
All headings within the article should have a top padding of 50px.
Set the layout of the main content section such that the 'related links' portion is to the right of the article. (Hint: This might be a difficult task; you may require some additional research to complete it).

3. Create commits
As you complete Task 2 (CSS styling), you must regularly commit your work to your Git repository. For this task, you must make at least three (3) commits. Each commit message must be formatted according to the following:

The first line must be a summary of the changes, no longer than 72 characters in length,
The second line must be blank,
All lines below the second line must be formatted using Markdown and should contain:
One heading,
One ordered list of the changes made in the commit

4. Push your repository to GitHub, take Screenshots, and Submit

After completing Tasks 1-3, you are ready to prepare your CA for submission. Your submission must include:

Your styled HTML file (including CSS) completed in Step #2,
Screenshots of your GitHub repository clearly showing:
Commit history,
Commit messages,
Repository files
The commit messages must be fully visible in your screenshots.
